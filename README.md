### Andoroid Car Space Booking App
Uses Google CLoud REST API ad has a datastore on Firestore. Authentication is by email address and is handled by Firebase Auth.

The structure of the app follows MVP (Model View Presentation) with the following directory structure:

app
##src
####main
######java/com/pp1/parkingfinder
########model
########view
########util
####res
######layout

All of the presentation is handled in view - thus all the "activities". Model has casses that form the object models for customers, leasers, 
and making a booking. Utils handles services such as geocoding.

Requires Marshmello or above.
